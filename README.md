# owl-arduino

There are 3 Arduino files in this repo. Each varies in complexity and maturity, but they all accomplish more or less the same thing.

|Directory|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|prototypeForJon|Version 1: Original version John A sent. I think this was used at Potlatch 2017.|
|primitive_pwm|Version 2: improving robustness, may not work very well|
|auto_leveling|Version 3: Final version used at Sunbreak 2018|
